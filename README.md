#HIV Transmission in a Criminal Case

You are a researcher in a forensics laboratory. You are contacted by a lawyer representing a victim who accuses her physician of intentionally infecting her with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) after their romantic relationship ended. After receiving a vitamin B-12 injection from this doctor, the victim tested positive for HIV. The lawyer alleges that the shot contained infected blood from other HIV positive patients under the doctor’s care. Using HIV sequences from victim, patients of the doctor, and other people in the area, it is up to you to determine if the victim could have contracted HIV from her doctor’s shot or some other source.
##Goals:
1.	Perform a BLAST search to understand sequence data
2.	Conduct multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
3.	Build a phylogenetic tree
4.	Determine if defendant is guilty or not guilty 
###Part 1 - Looking at Sequence Data
1.	View the [sequence data]( in a text editor:
